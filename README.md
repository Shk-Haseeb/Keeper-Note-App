# Keeper Note App

A minimalist full-stack note-taking app built with the **MERN stack**. Designed to be clean, fast, and fully responsive, this app demonstrates end-to-end CRUD functionality and cloud deployment using **React**, **Express**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

### Why I Built This  
Note-taking is a common productivity need, but many tools are bloated or overly complex. I built Keeper as a lightweight solution to practice building a full-stack app with seamless frontend-backend integration, and to refine my skills in **React, RESTful APIs, and cloud deployment**.
