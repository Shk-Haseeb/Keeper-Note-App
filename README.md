## Keeper Note App

Keeper is a minimalist full stack note taking app built with the **MERN stack**. Designed to be clean, fast, and fully responsive, it supports full **CRUD** functionality and is deployed with **React**, **Express**, and **MongoDB Atlas**. I built Keeper to address the need for a lightweight alternative to bloated note taking tools, while also using it as a way to sharpen my skills in **full stack development**; particularly in **frontend and backend integration**, **RESTful APIs**, and **cloud deployment**.
